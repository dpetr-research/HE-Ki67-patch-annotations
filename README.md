## Requires installation of the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- patchify
- bs4
- lxml
- PIL

Since the patch generation script generates all patches from the annotation list, it is highly recommended to do some cleanup of the retrieved patches in or after the generation process to remove empty patches that have white areas with no tissue.
